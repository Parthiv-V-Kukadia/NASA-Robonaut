# NASA-Robonaut
This project will describe the design, implementation, and testing of a controller for a 3D model of one of NASAâ€™s Robonauts; similar to a segway robotic mobility platform. The Robonaut will attempt to race along randomly generated path in the least amount of time without crashing using the controller.
